;; This file will build a version of a relational programming language known as
;; microKanren, as detailed in this paper:
;; http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf
;;
;; There is a note in the second-to-last paragraph of that paper
;;
;;   We hope to implement other search strategies in a similarly straightforwrad
;;   manner, and perhaps develop a mechanism to change out search strategies
;;   during the course of a search.
;;
;; That is what we're going to do. We're going to extend microKanren to include
;; a mechanism to change out search strategies during the course of a search.
;;
;; The end goal will be to have a kanren implementation with which we can use a
;; neural network to guide the search, as done in this paper:
;; https://github.com/xuexue/neuralkanren

;; Let's get started.
;;
;; First, some data structures and nomenclature...
;;
;; "state" holds all of the global data that gets passed around in miniKanren. I
;; say "global", but we're writing this in a functional style, so it's only
;; global in the sense that it gets passed around to every function that needs
;; it. But it's not global in the sense of shared memory.
;;
;; What does the state entail?
;;
;; 1) a stream (â‰† a list) of "substitutions"
;; 2) an incrementing counter that servces as an identifier for "fresh" variables
;;
;; What is a "stream of substitutions?
;;
;; The whole point of this relational system is to be able to say something
;; like: "x relates to y in the sense that they are the same thing" and "y
;; relates to 1 in the sense that they are the same thing". This is a trival
;; example that undermines a more significant purpose of relational systems, but
;; it serves to demonstrate what is a stream of substitutions. A "substitution"
;; is a list that tracks the fact that x relates to y and y relates to 1. So,
;; later, if we want to figure out what is the ultimate value of x, we can walk
;; the substitution.
;;
;; We need a "stream" of substitutions because it's possible to create a
;; relation of the form "y is either 0 or 1". For that, we need one substitution
;; where y associates with 0 and another substitution where y associates with 1.
;;
;; Why is a stream "kind of" like a list, but not really a list?
;;
;; Imagine if we had a relation of the form "y is greater than 0". That would be
;; an infinite-length list. If we tried to operate on it, our program would
;; never terminate. A "stream" is a list in the sense of it's a "cons cell" (it
;; has a head and a tail), but the tail might be a function call instead of a
;; list. The function call will resolve to something that has a head and a tail
;; when it's invoked. So, you can always continue walking down the list, at your
;; leisure, by invoking the tail (when the tail is a function). (This isn't a
;; new concept. Nor is it specific to miniKanren. This is basically what the
;; `range` function does in Python, for example. I'm just calling out here to
;; clarify any confusion around the term "stream of substitutions".)
;;
;;                   Substitutions__    __Counter used to create unique fresh vars
;;                                  |  |
(define empty-state (vector 'state '() 0))
;;                                      |__Subsequent locations can be used for more constraints.

;; Let's visualize our substitutions
;;
;; A single substition (as part of a stream of them) might look like this:
;;
;; ( (#(0) . #(1)) (#(1) . 1) )
;;
;; You can translate that to the example I used above where I said "x relates to
;; y in the sence that they are the same thing" and "y relates to 1 in the sense
;; that they are the same thing":
;;
;; ( (  x  =   y ) (  y  = 1) )
;;
;; What operation might we want to perform on a substitution?
;;
;; We probably want to be able to answer "what is the ultimate value of x".
;;
;; To do that, we can search the substitution for the first pair that starts
;; with "x", and then if its tail is also a var, then search the substitution
;; for the first pair that starts with its tail. And continue rceursively until
;; we find something that is not a var or is a var but has no association.

;; term that the other term walked to. If both terms walk to pairs, then the
;; heads and tails of each are unified recursively. And finally, non-variable
;; non-pair terms unify if they are equal. Anything else, unification fails.

 ;;
 ;; Regarding the names `goal-fresh' and `goal-unify':
 ;;
 ;; It might seem odd to think of `fresh' as a goal in the same way that you
 ;; think ot `==' as a goal. I think that's because, in plain English, "goal"
 ;; implies some kind of intent or objective, like an intent to unify a var to a
 ;; value. `fresh' doesn't have that kind of intent. But remember, a goal is
 ;; just something that takes a state as input and returns a state (possibly
 ;; updated) as output. I tried to make that clear with the names in this

;; De-functionalizing the higher-order representation of goals and streams to a first-order implementation of microKanren
;;
;; What do we need to de-functionalize?
;;
;; The goal constructors, disj, conj, ==, and relate.
;;
;; The stream constructors: stream-append-map, stream-append, and zzz (a.k.a
;; pause in http://minikanren.org/workshop/2019/minikanren19-final2.pdf)
;;
;; In FOMR, this is done by defining the above in terms of structs, so that they
;; can be decomposed with the help of pattern matching. (Mature streams are
;; represented the same way as higher-order microKanren, a pair of an answer and
;; a remaining stream.)

;; Common code

;; Since Chez doesn't give us structs...
