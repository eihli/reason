# Neural Guided Constraint Logic Programming

## **Phase 1: Core System Setup**

### *Goal: Establish a working Racket-Python communication system and basic search functionality*

### **Step 1: Define the Racket Server**
- Implement a ZeroMQ REP socket in Racket to handle queries from the Python client.
- Accept constraint logic queries and parse them into a structured form.
- Return available search choices and partial results in JSON format.
- Implement basic error handling for malformed queries.

### **Step 2: Implement a Simple Python Client**
- Set up a ZeroMQ REQ socket to communicate with the Racket server.
- Send basic queries and parse the returned results.
- Implement a command-line interface to manually expand search choices.
- Validate that Python and Racket can successfully exchange messages.

### **Step 3: Implement Basic First-Order miniKanren**
- Port or refine a first-order miniKanren interpreter in Racket.
- Support unification, logic variables, and simple relations.
- Implement depth-bounded search for constraint resolution.
- Add serialization/deserialization utilities for converting results to JSON.

### **Step 4: Implement Neural Network Constraint Scoring**
- Set up a basic PyTorch model to score constraints.
- Tokenize constraint choices using `tiktoken` for consistent input representation.
- Implement a forward pass that embeds, encodes, and scores constraints.
- Define softmax-based selection strategy (greedy vs. stochastic).

### **Step 5: Test End-to-End Communication**
- Ensure the Python client can send a query, receive choices, and select a branch.
- Implement logging and debugging features to monitor search progression.
- Add unit tests to validate communication and result parsing.

## **Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning Integration**
### *Goal: Train a neural model to guide search efficiently*

### **Step 6: Implement Experience Replay Buffer**
- Store past (state, action, reward, next_state) tuples for training.
- Implement sampling strategies to balance exploration and exploitation.
- Define batch sizes and decay policies for efficient training.

### **Step 7: Implement Reward Function**
- Assign positive rewards for finding a valid solution.
- Penalize steps to encourage efficiency.
- Implement larger penalties for dead-end branches.

### **Step 8: Implement Policy Gradient Learning**
- Use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for stable updates.
- Define entropy regularization to maintain exploration.
- Implement a learning rate scheduler for stability.
- Add gradient clipping to prevent unstable training.

### **Step 9: Implement Environment Abstraction**
- Wrap Racket server interaction in a reinforcement learning environment.
- Allow flexible state representation and choice selection.
- Add functionality to reset and step through the environment.

### **Step 10: Run Initial Training and Evaluation**
- Train a baseline model on simple constraint problems.
- Track key metrics: success rate, average steps, and learning curves.
- Adjust hyperparameters and debug performance issues.

## **Phase 3: Experimentation & Optimization**
### *Goal: Improve the systemâ€™s efficiency, generalization, and configurability*

### **Step 11: Add Support for Different Neural Architectures**
- Experiment with transformers, RNNs, or CNN-based encoders.
- Compare performance across architectures.

### **Step 12: Implement Configurable Experimentation Pipeline**
- Allow parameterized training runs with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Implement automated result logging and visualization.

### **Step 13: Improve Generalization Performance**
- Train on small list problems (length 4-6), test on larger ones (7-9).
- Introduce cross-domain generalization experiments.

### **Step 14: Compare with Baseline Strategies**
- Implement random search and heuristic-based selection for comparison.
- Evaluate improvement over time with neural-guided search.

## **Final Testing and Deployment**
### *Goal: Ensure robustness and usability before open-sourcing or expanding further*

### **Step 15: Refactor and Optimize Code**
- Improve modularity and documentation.
- Ensure clean API design between Racket and Python.

### **Step 16: Implement Robust Logging & Debugging**
- Add error-handling mechanisms.
- Implement debugging tools for analyzing search traces.

### **Step 17: Finalize Testing and Deployment**
- Run extensive integration tests.
- Package the system for easy setup and use.
